# Lasor_Project
This is a Python program designed to automatically solve levels in the "Lazors" game by placing various types of blocks on a grid to direct laser paths through designated points. The project reads custom puzzle files (`. bff` format) and outputs solutions with block placements needed to solve each level.

# Usage
## Running the Program 
You can get the `. bff` file and run the program by passing the file path as an augment.
In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing `lasor.py` and run:
```markdown
python3 lasor.py file_path
```
Here, replace file_path with the path to your `. bff` file.

## Output
The program will generate an image file named `solution_output.png` that displays the solution and shows the time taken to solve it.
